Connector Arrows: Use arrows to connect the nodes and indicate the flow of the decision-making process. Arrows should point from the decision nodes to the outcome nodes or to other decision nodes. Use solid arrows for the main flow and dotted arrows for alternative paths or loops.\n\n5. Styling: Use different colors for the nodes and arrows to distinguish between different types of nodes or decision paths. For example, you can use a light blue color for the decision nodes and a light green color for the outcome nodes. Use a thicker line width for the main flow arrows and a thinner line width for alternative paths or loops.\n\n6. Labels: Add labels to the arrows to provide additional information or context for each decision or outcome. Place the labels near the arrows and use a smaller font size to differentiate them from the node labels.\n\n7. Formatting: Ensure that the text in the nodes and labels is legible by using a clear and readable font. Adjust the size of the nodes and arrows to create a balanced and visually appealing layout. Leave enough space between the nodes to avoid clutter and make the diagram easy to follow.\n\nRemember to keep the flowchart concise and organized.

These titles should reflect the different criteria or dimensions you want to consider in your decision-making process. For example, if you are evaluating potential projects, the quadrant titles could be \"Cost,\" \"Impact,\" \"Feasibility,\" and \"Strategic Fit.\"\n\n2. Nodes: Within each quadrant, you will have nodes representing individual options, choices, or alternatives. These nodes should be labeled with the specific options you are evaluating. For instance, if you are considering different project ideas, the nodes could include project names or descriptions.\n\n3. Connections: Connect the nodes within each quadrant to indicate their position or placement based on the criteria you are evaluating. For example, if a particular project has a high impact and low cost, you would draw a line connecting it within the corresponding quadrant.\n\n4. Quadrant Dividers: To clearly separate the quadrants, draw vertical and horizontal lines to create a grid-like structure. This will help visually organize the chart and make it easier to interpret.\n\n5. Color Coding: Use different colors to distinguish the quadrants and make them visually appealing. You can choose colors that align with your preference or the context of your decision. For example, you could use shades of blue for one quadrant, green for another, and so on.\n\n6. Styling: To enhance the readability and aesthetics of the diagram, consider using a larger font size for the quadrant titles and node labels. Additionally, you can use bold or italic formatting for emphasis. Ensure that the text is legible and contrasting with the background color of the chart.\n\n7. Legend: Include a legend or key that explains the meaning of the colors and symbols used in the diagram. This will make it easier for viewers to understand the chart at a glance.\n\n8. Overall Layout: Arrange the quadrants in a symmetrical manner to maintain a balanced visual composition. You can position the quadrants in a square or rectangular shape, with the quadrant titles placed outside the chart for clarity.\n\nRemember to keep the diagram uncluttered and avoid overcrowding nodes or text within each quadrant. Use whitespace effectively to create a clean and visually appealing design.",

        content: "As a Mermaid Requirement Diagram creator, I will assist you in visualizing a decision-making process. The diagram will aim to represent the key nodes and connections involved in the process, ensuring clarity and visual appeal. Here's a breakdown of the diagram's content:\n\n1. Overall Structure:\n   - The diagram will be structured hierarchically, with the main decision at the top and subsequent sub-decisions branching out below it.\n   - The main decision will be represented as a central node, surrounded by the sub-decisions as child nodes.\n   - Each sub-decision will have its own set of child nodes if further branching is required.\n\n2. Key Nodes:\n   - Main Decision: This will be the central node of the diagram, representing the primary decision that needs to be made. It should be labeled clearly and placed at the top of the diagram.\n   - Sub-Decisions: These nodes will branch out from the main decision and represent the choices or options available. Each sub-decision should be labeled appropriately to indicate the specific choice.\n   - Outcome Nodes: These nodes will represent the potential outcomes or results associated with each sub-decision. They should be placed below the corresponding sub-decision nodes and labeled accordingly.\n\n3. Connections:\n   - Arrows: Arrows will be used to connect the main decision node to the sub-decision nodes and the sub-decision nodes to their respective outcome nodes. The arrows should indicate the direction of the decision-making flow.\n   - Labels: Each arrow connecting the nodes should have a label that describes the relationship between the connected nodes. For example, \"Option A leads to Outcome X\" or \"Option B results in Outcome Y.\"\n\n4. Formatting and Styling:\n   - Font and Size: Use a legible font for the text within the nodes and arrows. The font size should be consistent and large enough to ensure readability.\n   - Colors: Choose colors that are visually appealing and provide good contrast. You can use different colors for the main decision, sub-decisions, outcome nodes, and arrows to make the diagram more visually engaging.\n   - Alignment: Ensure that the nodes and arrows are aligned properly to maintain a clean and organized appearance. Nodes should be evenly spaced, and arrows should be straight and directly connect the corresponding nodes.\n   - Box Styling: Consider using rounded corners or subtle shading to give the nodes a visually appealing look. However, avoid excessive styling that may distract from the clarity of the diagram.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the Mermaid Requirement Diagram will effectively represent the decision-making process, making it visually appealing and easy to understand.",
